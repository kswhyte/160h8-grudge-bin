The main goal of this app is to allow a user to add a person who has wronged them to a list of 'most hated', the grudge bin. A user is able to provide a reason the person wronged them and add a respective date. Then if they so chose, they can forgive that person, leave them unforgiven, or toggle back and forth over time. This app also allows a user to keep an ongoing count of the number of people on the list and a count of those forgiven/unforgiven. The user can also sort their list of monsters by name or date of their horrid act.
